    "## COPD \"Rescue Packs\"\n",
    "A COPD \"rescue pack\" is a prescriptin for a short course of steroids and antibiotics that are issued in advance and a person with COPD keeps on-hand to use when they identify and self-diagnose an exacerbation in line with a their management plan. A [Cochrane review](https://www.cochrane.org/CD011682/AIRWAYS_self-management-interventions-including-action-plans-patients-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease) has found  _the number of people who had at least one hospital admission related to lung disease was reduced among those who participated in a self-management intervention (moderate-quality evidence)_."

Where appropriate these may be issued in advance to people with self management plans. The following notebooks contains SnoMed/[NHS Dictionary of Medicines and Devices](https://ebmdatalab.net/what-is-the-dmd-the-nhs-dictionary-of-medicines-and-devices/) codes to identify these medicines in a electronic health record. When applying to an EHR we should identify presence of a steroid and antibiotic issued on the same day. NICE currently recommends five days but we will use a week to be pragmatic in case a GP has chose to give slightly longer. We should also look for 10 days as sme practices may issue two rescue packs on a single prescription.\n",
